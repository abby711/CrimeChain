## Crime-Chain
<p> A simple implementation of a linear Blockchain model using python where ,as per the type of violations (Theft,Domestic Violence, Armbed Robbery etc) linear blocks are created to that of the genesis block.
  therby implementing the linked list structure.</p>
  The project involves the following implementation.
  <ol>
  <li>To create and constuct a structure to store the data</li>
<li>To develop multiple linear chains to the genesis block as per the type of crime reported.</li>
<li>To store the hash Values of each block along with respective timestamps </li>
</ol>
